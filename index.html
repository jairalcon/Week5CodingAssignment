<!-- JS is a front-end programming language. Node.js came out in 2009 which allowed it to be

We have to think about what all the small steps are, programming them one at a time. -->

<!-- git
    git workflow:

    -Pull down changes so your workspace is up to date
    -Make changes
    -Stage your changes
    -Take a snapshot of those changes
    -Push changes to the remote branch
    -Merge that branch into the master branch
    -->

    <!-- When working on a project with a team, making sure everyone has the same, 
        up-to-date code is important. 

Git is a Source Control tool used to enable teams to collaborate on projects at the same time. 
If users make changes to the same file that would overwrite one another, 
git provides merge conflict messages that enable users to manually adjust the multiple changes 
so that no one's code is overwritten. Git also keeps track of all the changes made to a project 
by using save-points called commits. 

GitHub is a web-based git GUI that enables us to visually manage 
our repositories and push our code to the cloud (GitHub servers). 

To start a new project (which we will do each week in this program), 
we need to create a new directory on our computer that will contain our 
project/assignment code and then create a new repository on GitHub. 
Once we create the repository on GitHub, 
it will give us a list of commands to run via the 
command line in the directory we created for our project. For example:


1. We create a new directory for our weekly project on our 
CLI - 'mkdir week1Assignment'

2. We log in to our GitHub account and create a new repository 
(name could be something like week1Assignment, as well).

3. We run the commands that GitHub gives us in our 
CLI in the directory we made (i.e. we have to cd into the directory first).


The commands typically look like this:

echo "# week1assignment" >> README.md

git init

git add README.md

git commit -m "first commit"

git branch -M main

git remote add origin https://github.com/GitUser/week1assignment.git

git push -u origin main -->

<!--- Note, instead of running 'git add README.md' we can run 'git add .' to add all files.


Our CLI may prompt us with the following message:

----------------------------------------------------

Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

----------------------------------------------------


If it does, we need to run the suggested commands and replace "you@example.com" and "Your Name" with our email and our name.

You may also need to create a token. You can do so by following the official guide here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

After running these commands, our local computer's repository will be connected to the remote repository on GitHub and we can follow a git workflow to keep our code synced and uploaded to GitHub.


Below is an overview of a basic git workflow.

1. Pull down any changes so our workspace is up to date using the command 'git pull' in our existing git repository.

2. Make any changes to our code or files.

3. Stage the changes by using 'git add [files we want to add]' or 'git add .' to add all changed/new files.

4. Take a snapshot of those changes (a commit) with 'git commit -am "commit message"' where the commit message is a short note summarizing what changes/additions we made. 

5. Push changes to a remote branch using 'git push origin master:[branch name]' where branch name is the name of the branch we are pushing to.

6. Create a pull request to merge our branch into the Main branch (this will be done on GitHub in our case). -->
